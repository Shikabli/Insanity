<h1>Insanity reference</h1>
<h2>Game rules</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>You have 5 lifes at the beggining.</p>
<p>Try to avoid clicking red circles as possible.</p>
<aside>
<div class="niceDiv">
This means e.g. in level lower than 5 you have to click at least 55 green circles to level up.
</div>
</aside>
<p>After reaching checkpoint you gain one life. Below level 5 at the start of the round you first have to click at least 10 green circles in a row to reach checkpoint. Next checkpoint is then only 9 green circles away. This goes down to 1 green circle. If you hit it, you level up.</p>
<p>Above level 4 is the first checkpoint calculated from formula: <span class="formula">8 + (currentLevel/2)</span></p>
<p>Above level 4 you do not have to click the circles, but drive mouse over those.</p>
<p>If you hit green circle, you get score points calculated from this formula: <span class="formula">15 * currentLevel</span> If you did not hit it, then you have lost one life.</p>
<p>If you hit the red one, your score is decreased by the appropriate value calculated from this formula: <span class="formula">15 * currentLevel * RedOnesClicked</span></p>
<p>If you hit the red one and you have less score points than to be substracted, you lose one life and all left score points.</p>
<p>Game ends when you have no lifes.</p>
<h2>Tips & tricks</h2>
<p>For the best game experience turn on fullscreen by pressing F11 (Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox).</p>
<aside>
<div class="niceDiv">
Maximal level speed is calulated from average human response time while using touchpad.
</div>
</aside>
<p>Stay with your cursor in the center of the screen - this is the closest way to all directions.</p>
<p>You might think circles are too fast to click them, but if you stay focused, you can hit them all!</p>
<p>Take a while to relax after each 'death' - about 2 minutes is recommended to stay sharp!</p>
<p>Above level 4 you stay with your mouse rather above than in the bottom - you never know if the next one is red circle!</p>
<p>Do not freak out after hitting red circle for the first time in a round. This is okay, until you hit the red one for more than 3 times. You can loose really a lot of score by hitting more red circles in one round. See the formula above.</p>

<p><b>This is not done yet!</b>To pause the game just move your mouse out of the window. To resume, enter the window with your mouse again.</p>
