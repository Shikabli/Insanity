### Author's speech

  It would be great if there was an active developer's community working on Insanity. Now it uses quite lightweight core with simple rules to follow, but in the future there could appear many forks with similar ideas.
  
  So please let me know you like to continue working on Insanity on your own so I can add your work in the list below.
